## Overview
NEAT machine learning library for Rust and Python. Tyrosine is implemented
using Rust and CUDA (for hardware acceleration). For Python bindings, PyO3 is
used.

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is a genetic algorithm which
evolves a population of neural networks. NEAT aims to find an optimal set of
weights in addition to an optimal neural network structure.

## Trivia
Tyrosine is an amino acid. The word comes from the Greek "tyros", which means
cheese.
