Want flexible use between CUDA and no CUDA, we want to test different
implementations of the neural networks, and the best way is to create different
Creature types, each with a different implementation. Since a GenerationManager
must manage a population of creatures, and each creature should simply be a
pointer to a creature because they may be able to transfer between generations,
we should simply allow GenerationManager to store pointers to objects which
implement a Creature trait. This way we can keep it flexible. If the setting to
disallow generation hopping is enabled then it would be rather slow to use a
bunch of pointers instead of contiguous memory but since we don't know what
implementation we'll be using we may not be able to create a GenerationManager
that can store a contiguous block of creatures. Actually it may be possible
anyway with enums. If we make an enum, one for each implementation, then the
GenerationManager will be just fine. In this case we can simply make a
GenerationManager trait, and have two types of GenerationManager, one that uses
pointers to objects and allows generation hopping, and one contiguous one that
disallows generation hopping. These can both be benchmarked.
-tldr; different Creature implementations depending on the neural network
type and a centralized Creature trait, and two GenerationManagers (one
contiguous and one pointers) with a common GenerationManager trait



Python will have a Pythonized GenerationManager object, which will simply
contain a pointer to an object that implements the GenerationManager trait.



For Go, maybe create simple functions and such, and create a Go file that will
create structs and methods and interface with the simplified NEAT interface.
This method may be necessary because I'm not sure if ABI supports structs. Even
so Go support will be on the back-burner until much later, after Python and
Rust support has been added.



Read genomes from file in two ways: no mangle and mangle. With mangle, the
original node id's are thrown out and recalculated to maximize upper space. In
this way, there is a small amount of processing time at the start, but it
ensures id's are reset so that unused id's can be used once again instead of
skipped. With no mangle, the id's as saved are used. This means comparisons
between generations are possible, at the cost of not being able to reuse id's
that have dropped support. No mangle will be the default for now, but with the
option of allowing id mangling.
